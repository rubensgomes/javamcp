# Repository configuration
repositories:
    # The default branch in the remote Git repository is cloned.  That is,

    # branch has most commonly been named master, but main has become an 
    # increasingly prevalent default in recent years, particularly on 
    # platforms like GitHub. Other names like trunk or development are also
    # used.
