### GitRepositoryManager

The GitRepositoryManager should handle the cloning and updating of the Git repositories. Its main focus should be to clone the remote Git repositories in local folders.  It should first check if the Git repository already exists locally.  If it does, then it should sync the local repository with the remote.  Otherwise, it should do a fresh clone of the remote repository.

The GitRepositoryManager should take as inputs:

- A list of Git repository URLs.
- A local directory path where the repositories will be cloned or updated.

The GitRepositoryManager should report errors if any repository cannot be cloned or updated.

For simplicity, the following limitations apply:

1. Private repositories and authentication are not supported.
2. Only the main Git Repository branch is cloned/updated.
