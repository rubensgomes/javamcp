# Understanding of CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE_PYTHON.md

**Source:** `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `~/.claude/CLAUDE_PYTHON.md`

## Workflow
- Must plan first and get approval before implementation
- Store plans in `misc/tasks/` with checkbox format (`- [ ]`)
- Work incrementally, checking off tasks as completed
- Use high-level summaries for communication
- Add Review section when wrapping up
- Must check off checkboxes as tasks complete

## Coding Standards
- Clarity over cleverness, SOLID & Clean Code principles
- Functions: <20 lines ideal, max 60 lines
- Descriptive names, no abbreviations
- Document all public code
- No globals/static state, never swallow exceptions
- Early returns to avoid deep nesting
- Named constants instead of magic numbers
- Immutability and pure functions preferred
- DRY principle, meaningful logging with context

## Critical Constraints
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files
- NEVER proactively create documentation files
- Do only what's asked, nothing more

## Python-Specific
- Black formatting, PEP8 standards
- Poetry layout: `src/` for source, `tests/` for tests
- Type hints everywhere, Pydantic for DTOs
- async/await for I/O, f-strings for formatting
- pathlib over os.path, with statement for files
- `is`/`is not` for None checks
- Add `# Generated by Claude` to new files
- Add `# Modified by Claude` before modifications

## Testing
- pytest framework mirroring src/ structure
- pytest fixtures, pytest-cov, pytest-mock
- Mock only external dependencies (DB, APIs)
- @pytest.mark.parametrize for multiple inputs
- Test behavior not implementation
- Small, focused, fast tests
- Test success, failure, edge cases, error handling
- Aim for 80%+ coverage, clear test names
