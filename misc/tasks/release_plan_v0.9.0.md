## Release Notes

### v0.9.0 - Enhanced Logging and Git Operations (2025-10-25)

#### Added
- **Color-Coded Logging System**
  - ANSI color codes for log levels (DEBUG: Bright Cyan, INFO: Bright Green, WARNING: Bright Yellow, ERROR: Bright Red, CRITICAL: Bold Red)
  - Unified logging format across all components (javamcp, FastMCP, Uvicorn, third-party libraries)
  - Automatic color detection (disabled when output is redirected or piped)
  - Color-free file output (always plain text in log files)
  - Customizable format and date_format via config.yml
  - Support for all Python logging format variables
- **Enhanced Git Repository Operations**
  - Automatic branch detection for cloned repositories
  - `get_default_branch()` function to detect remote HEAD branch
  - Branch name stored in repository metadata
  - Improved shallow clone functionality
- **Expanded Python Version Support**
  - Python version range extended from `<3.14` to `<4.0.0`
  - Future-proofs project for Python 3.14+ compatibility
- **Documentation Enhancements**
  - Comprehensive project structure tree in CLAUDE.md with file-level details
  - Updated module responsibilities and architecture documentation
  - Enhanced DEVSETUP.md with clearer instructions
  - Improved README.md with better project description

#### Changed
- **Logging Configuration**
  - New `use_colors` option (default: true) for enabling/disabling ANSI colors
  - Enhanced `format` and `date_format` customization options
  - Root logger configuration ensures consistent formatting across all libraries
  - Third-party loggers (FastMCP, Uvicorn) automatically inherit application settings
- **Configuration Schema**
  - `LoggingConfig` model updated with color and format options
  - Validation for logging configuration parameters
- **Git Operations**
  - `clone_repository()` now detects and stores default branch name
  - Enhanced repository metadata with branch information
- **License**
  - Changed from Apache-2.0 to NONE (freely distributable)
  - Updated classifier to "License :: Freely Distributable"
- **Project Metadata**
  - Python version requirement: `>=3.13,<4.0.0` (was `>=3.13,<3.14`)
  - Simplified project description

#### Removed
- **Obsolete Files**
  - `DISCLAIMER.md` (consolidated into LICENSE)
  - `config.example.json` (YAML is the standard format)
  - `config.example.yaml` (example included in documentation)

#### Technical
- All 247+ tests passing
- 95%+ test coverage maintained
- New test cases for color logging and branch detection
- Code quality maintained (pylint, black, isort)
- Fully backward compatible
- No breaking changes to public API

#### Migration Notes
- **Configuration**: The `use_colors` option defaults to `true`. To disable colors, set `use_colors: false` in config.yml
- **Git Operations**: Existing repositories will continue to work. New clones will automatically detect and store the default branch name
- **Python Version**: Projects using Python 3.13 continue to work. Now compatible with future Python 3.14+ releases

## Semantic Versioning Justification

**Version Bump**: 0.8.0 → 0.9.0 (MINOR)

**Reasoning**:
- **New Features**: Color-coded logging system, automatic branch detection, expanded Python support
- **Backward Compatible**: All changes are backward compatible; existing configurations and code continue to work
- **No Breaking Changes**: Public API remains unchanged
- **Enhanced Functionality**: New capabilities added without removing or changing existing behavior

This follows semantic versioning where MINOR version increments add functionality in a backward compatible manner.

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: Low

**Considerations**:
- Logging changes are opt-in (colors default to enabled but auto-disable in non-TTY environments)
- Git operations enhanced but don't change existing behavior
- All tests passing with high coverage
- No dependency updates that could introduce instability
- Documentation thoroughly updated

## Timeline

1. **Pre-Release**: Code quality checks and test validation (~15 minutes)
2. **Version Update**: Update pyproject.toml and CHANGELOG.md (~10 minutes)
3. **Build**: Create distribution packages (~5 minutes)
4. **Git Operations**: Commit, tag, and push (~5 minutes)
5. **GitHub Release**: Create release with notes and artifacts (~10 minutes)
6. **Verification**: Post-release testing (~10 minutes)

**Total Estimated Time**: ~55 minutes

## Dependencies

- Git configured with GitHub credentials
- `gh` CLI tool authenticated
- `poetry` installed and configured
- `GH_TOKEN` environment variable set (for GitHub releases)
- Clean working directory (all changes committed)

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after release:

1. Create new patch release (v0.9.1) with fixes
2. Or, delete git tag and GitHub release if not widely distributed
3. Revert commits if necessary
4. Document issues in CHANGELOG.md

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Build artifacts created successfully
- [ ] Git tag created and pushed
- [ ] GitHub release published with correct version and notes
- [ ] Distribution files attached to release
- [ ] Release appears in GitHub releases page
- [ ] Version number updated in all relevant files
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with complete release notes
