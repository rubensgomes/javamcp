# Logging Initialization Fix Implementation

## Problem Statement

The logging configuration was happening after FastMCP server instantiation in `__main__.py`, causing the FastMCP library to use different logging settings than the application codebase. This occurred because:

1. `server.py:64-71` - FastMCP instance created at module import time
2. `__main__.py:127` - Logging configured in `main()` function after imports
3. When `from javamcp.server import mcp` executes, FastMCP already initializes its own logging before `setup_logging()` is called

## Solution Approach

Implemented lazy initialization pattern with root logger configuration:

### 1. Created Server Factory Module
- **File**: `src/javamcp/server_factory.py`
- **Purpose**: Provides lazy FastMCP instance creation
- **Key Function**: `get_mcp_server()` - Creates FastMCP instance only when called

### 2. Updated Logging Configuration
- **File**: `src/javamcp/logging/logger.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Configure root logger instead of just application logger
  - Ensures all libraries (including FastMCP) use same logging settings
  - Prevents duplicate log messages by managing handlers at root level

### 3. Refactored Server Module
- **File**: `src/javamcp/server.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed module-level FastMCP instantiation
  - Removed `@mcp.tool()` and `@mcp.resource()` decorators from functions
  - Added `register_tools_and_resources()` function to register all tools/resources after logging setup
  - Tools and resources now registered dynamically after logging configuration

### 4. Updated Main Entry Point
- **File**: `src/javamcp/__main__.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Setup logging BEFORE importing server components
  - Call `register_tools_and_resources()` after logging configuration
  - Get MCP server instance from factory after registration

### 5. Updated Module Exports
- **File**: `src/javamcp/__init__.py`
- **Changes**: Export `get_mcp_server` instead of `mcp` instance

## Implementation Details

### Execution Flow (Before Fix)
```
1. Import javamcp.server
2. FastMCP instance created (uses default logging)
3. load_config()
4. setup_logging() ❌ Too late!
5. initialize_server()
6. mcp.run()
```

### Execution Flow (After Fix)
```
1. load_config()
2. setup_logging() ✅ Configures root logger first!
3. register_tools_and_resources() (creates FastMCP instance)
4. initialize_server()
5. get_mcp_server().run()
```

## Modified Files

- ✅ `src/javamcp/server_factory.py` - NEW: Lazy FastMCP initialization
- ✅ `src/javamcp/logging/logger.py` - Configure root logger
- ✅ `src/javamcp/server.py` - Refactored to use factory pattern
- ✅ `src/javamcp/__main__.py` - Initialize logging before server creation
- ✅ `src/javamcp/__init__.py` - Updated exports
- ✅ `tests/server/test_server.py` - Updated imports and assertions
- ✅ `tests/logging/test_logger.py` - Updated to check root logger handlers

## Test Results

All 263 tests passing:
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/ -v
============================= 263 passed =========================
```

Key test categories:
- Config loading and validation
- Context building and formatting
- API indexing and querying
- Logging configuration (now checks root logger)
- Server initialization
- Tool and resource registration

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Logging**: Both application and FastMCP library use same logging configuration
2. **Proper Initialization Order**: Logging configured before any library code executes
3. **Clean Architecture**: Lazy initialization pattern separates concerns
4. **Backward Compatible**: All existing tests pass with minor updates
5. **Root Logger Control**: Configuring root logger ensures all child loggers inherit settings

## Technical Notes

### Why Root Logger Configuration?

Configuring the root logger (`logging.getLogger()`) ensures that:
- All loggers in the application hierarchy use the same configuration
- Third-party libraries (like FastMCP) automatically inherit settings
- No duplicate log messages (handlers only on root, not on child loggers)
- Centralized control over all logging output

### Lazy Initialization Pattern

The factory pattern with lazy initialization:
- Delays FastMCP creation until after logging is configured
- Allows tools and resources to be registered programmatically
- Maintains singleton pattern (single MCP instance)
- Provides clean separation between configuration and instantiation

## Verification

To verify the fix works correctly:

1. Both application and FastMCP logs now use the same format
2. All logs output to the same handlers (console/file)
3. Log level configuration applies to all components
4. No duplicate log messages

## Review

✅ **Logging initialization fix completed successfully!**

**Completed Tasks:**
- Created `server_factory.py` with lazy FastMCP initialization
- Modified `logging/logger.py` to configure root logger
- Refactored `server.py` to use factory pattern
- Updated `__main__.py` to initialize logging before server creation
- Updated all tests to work with new pattern
- All 263 tests passing

**Summary:**
The logging initialization issue has been resolved by implementing lazy initialization for the FastMCP server instance and configuring the root logger before any library code executes. This ensures that both the application codebase and the FastMCP library use consistent logging settings throughout execution.
