  - Warns users that output may contain inaccuracies, errors, or security vulnerabilities
  - Addresses third-party content notice and licensing compliance responsibilities
  - Clarifies copyright status: AI-generated portions are public domain; copyright protection limited to human contributions only
  - Includes limitation of liability and no-warranty disclaimers

- **AI Disclaimer Headers**: All 72 Python files updated
  - Added comprehensive disclaimer header to every source and test file
  - Header includes:

- **Code Quality**: Pylint score maintained at ~9.73/10
- **Backward Compatibility**: Fully compatible with v0.3.0

### Impact

This release makes **no functional changes** to the JavaMCP server. All 4 MCP tools and 1 MCP resource continue to work exactly as before. The only changes are:

1. Licensing model (Apache 2.0 → AI-Generated Content Disclaimer)
2. File headers (Apache 2.0 headers → AI disclaimer headers)
3. Documentation (added DISCLAIMER.md and README.md section)

### Why This Change?

This transition better reflects:
- The reality of how modern software is increasingly developed with AI assistance
- Transparency about the AI-generated nature of the codebase
- Appropriate copyright and liability considerations for AI-generated content
- Clear warnings about potential inaccuracies or vulnerabilities

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No regression issues reported
- [ ] DISCLAIMER.md visible and accessible
- [ ] All Python files have AI disclaimer headers
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects changes
- [ ] Code quality metrics maintained

## Notes

### Semantic Versioning Rationale

- **MINOR version bump** (0.3.0 → 0.4.0) because:
  - This is a significant project-wide change affecting all files
  - While not a functional change, it represents a major documentation/licensing shift
  - Users should be aware of the change through version number
  - No breaking changes to functionality

### Legal Considerations

- The new disclaimer is more appropriate for AI-generated content
- Clarifies copyright status (public domain for AI portions)
- Provides appropriate limitation of liability
- Warns users about potential issues with AI-generated code
- Users/distributors remain responsible for third-party license compliance

### Communication Points

Key messages for this release:
1. No functional changes - all features work identically
2. Licensing model changed to better reflect AI-generated nature
3. Increased transparency about project origins
4. Appropriate disclaimers and liability limitations
5. Continued commitment to code quality and testing
