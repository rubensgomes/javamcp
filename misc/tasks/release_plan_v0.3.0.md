## New Feature Highlights

### ProjectContextBuilder Class

The new `ProjectContextBuilder` provides:
- **Repository Information**: Name and URL extraction
- **README Content**: Automatic detection and extraction
- **LLMs.txt Support**: Context file for LLM integration
- **API Statistics**: Comprehensive metrics calculation
- **Package Summaries**: Detailed per-package information
- **Top Classes**: Most significant classes with documentation
- **Coverage Metrics**: Javadoc documentation coverage rates

### Resource URI Pattern

```
javamcp://project/{repository_name}/context
```

Where `repository_name` is extracted from the Git URL (e.g., "commons-lang" for "https://github.com/apache/commons-lang.git").

### Response Structure

The resource returns a JSON response with:
- `repository_name`: Repository identifier
- `repository_url`: Full Git URL
- `description`: Generated project overview
- `readme_content`: Full README.md content (if available)
- `llms_txt_content`: LLM context file content (if available)
- `statistics`: Total classes, methods, packages, averages
- `packages`: Array of package summaries with counts
- `top_classes`: Most significant classes with Javadocs
- `javadoc_coverage`: Documentation coverage metrics

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Release**:
- Additive changes only (no modifications to existing functionality)
